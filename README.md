# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NYC Airbnb

## Introduction
Airbnb is a service that allows people to rent their homes to those looking for affordable accommodation around the world. The company also provides its users with what they call experiences - paid activities designed and led by locals - such as surfing at sunset, hiking with rescue dogs, and food tours.

New York City – one of the world's most famous cities – plays an important part in international finance, politics, entertainment, and culture. It is not surprising that the home of Central Park and such wonderful museums, skyscrapers, and stores attracts countless tourists all year long. And just like in other big cities, travelers can pick and choose from a number of accommodation options, including Airbnb.

We will dive into an Airbnb dataset from 2019 to learn about rental options and how they are distributed around the city's five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island.

## About the data
The dataset used in this project was made available by [Dgmonov](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov), and the original source can be found at [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/). The data was collected in 2019 and it's stored in a CSV file – it includes information about hosts and their listings, price, boroughs, neighborhoods, number of reviews, minimum nights, and more.

## Tools
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
